Hello! Start at loggedIn.jsp, and go exploring from there!
I have done my best to make sure the file is submitted the way the submission instructions explain. I have also spent dozens of hours on this project and have tried testing in multiple times on my own laptop and other's laptops after sending it to them as a zipfile like the submission says. If there's a huge loss of functionality somehow, I would greatly appreciate emailing me at jmccoll@usc.edu so I can try to fix/explain any loss in functionality. Thanks so much.
